Here are some excellent and free resources to learn more.
They are listed in the recommended reading order.

## The Pro Git 2 book

Let's start with the resource I like best: the **Pro Git 2** book.
I recommend that newcomers to Git read chapters 1, 2 and 3.
Read the [ProGit2 book at git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

## How to change your Git history

You can clean up messy work with `git rebase` before showing it to the world or your co-workers.
Using `git rebase` without knowing what you're doing is a recipe for disaster.
Go to the [git-rebase.io](https://git-rebase.io/) website to get plenty of hands-on exercise with `git rebase`.

## Learn more Git workflows

Martin Fowler made a great guide covering all kinds of Git workflows, it's called **Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches**.

[Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches at martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html)

I recommend that you read the chapter on [Integration Frequency at martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html#integration-frequency).

## How to use `git send-email`

Projects like Git and the Linux kernel use an e-mail based workflow instead of a pull request based workflow.
I don't cover the e-mail workflow at all, as I want to focus on the Git CLI and the GitHub interface.

The [git-send-email.io](https://git-send-email.io/) site contains good information and exercises on sending patches via e-mail.
