Here are some excellent and free resources to learn more.
They are listed in the recommended reading order.

## The Pro Git 2 book

Let's start with the resource I like best: the **Pro Git 2** book.
I recommend that newcomers to Git read chapters 1, 2 and 3.
Read the [ProGit2 book at git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

## How to change your Git history

You can clean up messy work, with `git rebase`, before showing it to the world or your co-workers.
Using `git rebase` without knowing what you're doing is a recipe for disaster.

The [git-rebase.io](https://git-rebase.io/) website will get you plenty of hands-on `git rebase` exercise.

## Learn more Git workflows

Martin Fowler made a great guide covering all kinds of Git workflows, it's called **Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches**.

[Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches at martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html)

I highly recommend that you read the chapter on [Integration Frequency at martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html#integration-frequency).

## How to use `git send-email`

Projects such as Git and the Linux kernel use an email based workflow.
This workflow is way different to what you're used to with GitHub or GitLab.

Fortunately there's an excellent hands-on guide that will teach you how to send patches with `git send-email`.
The guide will tell you how to configure Git so that you can use it with your email.
Then you'll get hands-on and actually send a patch via email, and deal with feedback.
You'll also learn handy tips and tricks.

## Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)

Git does not deal with large files properly.
Use the Git Large File Storage extension to work with large files.

Download Git LFS from [git-lfs.github.com](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
It's available for Linux, Windows and macOS.

:::tip How to work with LFS
Read the [GitHub docs, Managing large files](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-large-files).
:::

:::note GitHub enforces filesize limits
GitHub enforces file/repository size limits when you use Git LFS.

Read more about the limits in the [GitHub docs, About storage and bandwidth usage](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage).
