## Git's built-in manual

Git has a built-in manual, which you can read with any of the following commands:

```
$ git help <verb>
$ git <verb> --help
$ man git <verb>
```

Say you need more information on the `git config` command.
You can read the manual for the `git config` command by doing any of the following:

- `$ git help config`
- `$ git config --help`
- `$ man git config`

## Read a proper book (ProGit2)

I recommend that you read the [Pro Git 2 book](https://github.com/progit/progit2) online, it does not cost any money.
The ProGit2 book covers everything I talk about in this guide in more depth and more detail.
