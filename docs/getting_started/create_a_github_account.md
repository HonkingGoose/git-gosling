## Create a GitHub account

You need a GitHub account to follow this guide.
Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and create your account.

Need help with GitHub account creation?
Follow the steps in the [GitHub docs, Signing up for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).

### Verify your email address with GitHub

You must verify your email address.
Follow the steps in the [GitHub docs, Verifying your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/verifying-your-email-address).

### Secure your account with two-factor authentication

GitHub requires you to use 2FA by the end of 2023.

When you enable 2FA, you log in with something you know (password) plus something you have (app, physical security key, GitHub Mobile app).
Using 2FA makes it harder for somebody to access your account.

Follow the steps in the [GitHub docs, Configuring two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).

Write down or print the recovery codes that GitHub gives you, and keep them somewhere safe!

### Create a personal access token (PAT)

To authenticate to GitHub you must use a personal access token, OAuth token, or GitHub App installation token.
Follow the steps in the [GitHub docs, Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token), to create your personal access token.

When Git asks for your password, you enter the personal access token instead.

## Summary

You have:

- Created a GitHub account.
- Verified your email address.
- Turned on two-factor authentication.
- Created a personal access token.

That was a lot of work, but you're ready to use GitHub now!
