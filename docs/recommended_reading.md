Here are some excellent and free resources to learn more.
They are listed in the recommended reading order.

## The Pro Git 2 book

Let's start with the resource I like best: the **Pro Git 2** book.
I recommend that newcomers to Git read chapters 1, 2 and 3.
Read the [ProGit2 book at git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

## How to change your Git history

You can clean up messy work, with `git rebase`, before showing it to the world or your co-workers.
Using `git rebase` without knowing what you're doing is a recipe for disaster.

The [git-rebase.io](https://git-rebase.io/) website will get you plenty of hands-on `git rebase` exercise.

## Learn more Git workflows

Martin Fowler made a great guide covering all kinds of Git workflows, it's called **Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches**.

[Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches at martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html#integration-frequency)

I highly recommend that you read the chapter on [Integration Frequency at martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html#integration-frequency).

## How to use `git send-email`

Projects such as Git and the Linux kernel use an email based workflow.
This workflow is way different to what you're used to with GitHub or GitLab.

Fortunately there's an excellent hands-on guide that will teach you how to send patches with `git send-email`.
The guide will tell you how to configure Git so that you can use it with your email.
Then you'll get hands-on and actually send a patch via e-mail, and deal with feedback.
You'll also learn handy tips and tricks.
