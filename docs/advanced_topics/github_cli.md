If you want to do all your work from within the command line interface, you might want to take a look at the GitHub CLI program called `gh`.
The `gh` program allows you to perform most of your GitHub workflow straight from the command line.

GitHub CLI is available for free on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

Go to the [GitHub CLI homepage](https://cli.github.com/) to download the `gh` program, and read the documentation.
