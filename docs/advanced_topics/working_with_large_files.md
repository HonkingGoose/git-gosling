## Git Large File Support

Git does not work with large files out-of-the-box.
This means files like high-resolution images, binaries, game assets.
The **Git Large File Storage** extension can help here.

Read the [Git LFS wiki on limitations](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Limitations) to find out if this will work for you.

The extension is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.
Download the extenstion from [git-lfs.github.com](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

:::warning GitHub enforces filesize limits
GitHub enforces file/repository size limits when you use Git LFS.

Read more about the limits in the [GitHub docs, About storage and bandwidth usage](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage).
