## Git Large File Support

Git does not work with large files out-of-the-box.
Large files are high-resolution images, binaries, game assets and so on.
The **Git Large File Storage** extension can help here.
The extension is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.

Read the [Git LFS wiki on limitations](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Limitations) to find out if LFS will work for you.
You can download the extension from [git-lfs.github.com](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Working with Git LFS on GitHub

Read the [GitHub docs, Managing large files](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files) to learn more.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "GitHub enforces file/repository size limits when you use Git LFS."
    Read more about the limits in the [GitHub docs, About storage and bandwidth usage](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage).
