## What will I learn?

You'll be able to use Git from the command line interface, and know the basics of working with GitHub.

### Git? What's that?

Git is a version control system, it tracks the history of a file/project.
You can use Git to share your work with co-workers or with the world.

Others can easily get a copy of your work, make improvements, and give those improvements back to you.
