title: Configuring Git
---

Before you can use Git, you must configure it.

## Tell Git who you are

Git must know your username and email.
Every time you save your work with a commit, Git puts your username and email in the commit message.

We'll use the `--global` option so that Git will use this username and email for everything you do on this system.

If you want to override the global name or email address for a specific project, you can run the command without the `--global` option when youâ€™re in that project.

### Username

Tell Git your username:

```git
$ git config --global user.name "Name Lastname"
```

:::warning
This username will be seen by anybody who has read rights to your repositories.
:::

:::tip
If you have a GitHub account: use your GitHub username!

Read the [GitHub docs on setting your username](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/setting-your-username-in-git)
:::


### Email

Tell Git your email address:

```git
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

:::warning
This email address will be seen by anybody who has read rights to your repositories.
:::

:::tip
If you have a GitHub account: use the `no-reply` email address that GitHub gives you.
For more on this read the [GitHub docs: setting your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address).

Alternatively you can use an email alias.

## Code editor setup

When you create a commit with `git commit`, Git will open the CLI text editor to let you enter a commit message.
By default, Git will use whatever your CLI uses, which will probably be the `vi`, `vim` or `nano` editor.

You can tell Git to use another text editor.
The `--wait` option tells Git to wait until you've saved the message and closed the commit message screen.

### Visual Studio Code

```git
$ git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

### VSCodium

```git
$ git config --global core.editor "codium --wait"
```

### Atom

```git
$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
```
