### Git? What's that?

Git is a version control system, it tracks the history of a file/project.
You can use Git to share your work with co-workers or with the world.

Others can easily get a copy of your work, make improvements, and give those improvements back to you.

### What files can I version control with Git?

Git works best with plain text file formats, like Markdown, AsciiDoctor, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON/YAML, etc.

Do not version control files from office suite programs like Microsoft Office or LibreOffice.
Using Git with files like Word documents or Excel spreadsheets won't work properly.

Git does not work with large files out-of-the-box.
This means files like high-resolution images, binaries, game assets.
Read the [Advanced topics, Working with Large Files](../advanced_topics/working_with_large_files.md) part of this guide to learn more.
